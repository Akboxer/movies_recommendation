<h2>MOVIES RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM BY TF-IDF MECHANISM IN PYTHON </h2>
In this we collected data of 5000 movies in a csv file and then we opened that in our python notebook . Then we cleared the data and made a dataframe of required data.
After that we made a TF-IDF martex which finds the importance of worde in a movies .
This is a m*n matrix where m can be the number  of movies and n can be the important words in the movie description ,
Then we found teh relationships between each and every pair of movies . This is called cosine relationship matrix .
Here 1 means fully relational and 0 means no relation . 
And top ten pairs of the movies are picked using indexing . DONE !!
